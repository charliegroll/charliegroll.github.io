He’s been working at Verizon Wireless since graduation, and he’s looking to bring his experience as a software developer to a new opportunity. While JavaScript is his language of choice, and his current role is as a UI/UX team leader and architect, he was originally hired for full-stack development and has experience designing, implementing, and supporting server-side code. Outside of work, he’s been a volunteer EMT since graduating high school and leads a fairly active life of running, biking, swimming, climbing, and the occasional hiking or backpacking trip.",
